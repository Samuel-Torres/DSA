1. Time complexity: is the amount time taken by an algorithm to execute. 
2. The amount of memory used by the algorithm while executing. 

Ways of analyzing Time complexity of an algorithms. 

Experimental Analysis: 
    • Can be measured by executing an algorithm on multiple inputs. Run-tim meaured on various inputs.
    • Most programming langauges provide time function. 
    • Lapse time is measured.

    Disadvantages:
        • Limited Input: can't test with every possible input.
        • Hardware dependent
        • Software dependent
        • Operating System dependent & Network Dependent


Theoretical Analysis:
    • Performed on description of the algorithm
    • Independent of the hardware, software, network, and operating system. 
    • 


Constant Execution Time:
    • Declaration
    • Assignment
    • Arithmetic Operations
    • Comparison Operations
    • Accessing Element
    • Calling Functions
    • Returning Functions

O(n) = Linear Time: time taken to compute an algorithm rises linearly compared to the size of n inputs.
O(1) = Constant Time:
O(n^2) = Quadratic Time:
