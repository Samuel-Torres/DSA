# Order of Growth:

# Performance Classification: 
    # • Constant 1
    # • Logorithm log(n)
    # • Linear n
    # • n-log-n n log(n)
    # • Quadratic n^2
    # • Cubic n^3
    # • Exponential 2^n

# Asymptotic Analysis:
    # Analysis using mathematical notations. 
    # Depends on order of growth ('n' size of input) 
    # Run time is properationate to size of input.

    # 1, 2, 3 4, .... 10... 20... 1000... 10000000 etc.

    # As the input size gets really big performance is impacted more. 
    # Asymptotic means approaching a value. 
    # #

    # In the circumstance where an element in a search algo is the first item in the array this scenario would make the algo run at
    # constant time. This is also known as the "best case". If it's the last element in the array in this situation the loop has to 
    # run until the last element also known as the worse case. #

    # Best case: lower bound aka easiest 
    # average case: average case
    # worse case: the worse scenario in terms of run time. #

    # Big O: use to explain worse case. 
    # Big Omega: lower bound --> Best case
    # Big Theta: average case --> tight bound #
